# Metrics

We collect various metrics and serve them via a Prometheus-compatible HTTP endpoint at `http://<metrics_address>:<metrics_port>/metrics` (default: `http://127.0.0.1:5054/metrics`).

A ready-to-use Grafana + Prometheus monitoring stack with pre-configured [leanMetrics](https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanMetrics) dashboards is available in [lean-quickstart](https://github.com/blockblaz/lean-quickstart).

The exposed metrics follow [the leanMetrics specification](https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanMetrics/blob/2719baad8351c9ad5eaf3c8621f33fcec20a1dc7/metrics.md), with some metrics not yet implemented. We have a full list of implemented metrics below, with a checkbox indicating whether each metric is currently supported or not.

✅(*) **Partial support**: These metrics are implemented but not collected "on scrape" as the spec requires. They are updated on specific events (e.g., on tick, on block processing) rather than being computed fresh on each Prometheus scrape.

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Desktop on MacOS

lean-quickstart uses the host network mode for Docker containers, which is a problem on MacOS.
To work around this, enable the ["Enable host networking" option](https://docs.docker.com/enterprise/security/hardened-desktop/settings-management/settings-reference/#enable-host-networking) in Docker Desktop settings under Resources > Network.
